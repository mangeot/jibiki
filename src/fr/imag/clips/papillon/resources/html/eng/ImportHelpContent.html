<p>It is possible to add on the Papillon server monolingual or multilingual documents of any type. 
Archive files (TAR or ZIP files) may be multilingual, while simple files (HTML, PDF, RTF, GIF, etc.) are monlingual.<br>
When a GZipped file is sent to be added, it is first unpacked; the file obtained is not directly added but treated exactly as if it was sent in its unpacked form.</p>

<h2>1. Addition of archive files (.tar, .zip)</h2>
<h3>1.1. Addition Process</h3>
<p>The archive is unpacked; its contents is analyzed, and then added. It can be a single compressed folder.
In that case, the term "root" indicates its contents. You can put on the archive root an XML file 
named <b>info_doc.xml</b> wich avoids having to fill the import form. This info_doc.xml description file indicates:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the section where you wish to put the document,</li>
  <li>the author(s) name(s),</li>
  <li>the title of the document in each available language,</li>
  <li>the creation date of the document (optional),</li>
  <li>some reference text if it is a publication (optional).</li>
</ul>
<p>If information have been entered in the form, it is ignored and replaced by those contained in info_doc.xml.<br>
The format of info_doc.xml is defined by the XML Schema <a href="XMLSchema.po">info_doc.xsd</a>.</p>
<p>ATTENTION: for HTML files, do not use any hexadecimal character entities like &amp;#x8A93; as the Tidy parser seems not able to recognize them.</p>
<h3>1.2. Different archives types</h3>
<p>There are three types of archives, wich are treated differently:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A multilingual HTML archive consists of a mini HTML site in several languages.</li>
  <li>A multilingual non-HTML archive contains several version of a same non-HTML document (for example a PDF or a RTF document) in different languages.</li>
  <li>A monolingual archive has a free content (it should not have the same format as a multilingual archive).</li>
</ul>
<p>A multilingual archive must have on its root the info_doc.xml file and then, for each language, a folder bearing the ISO 639-2/T 3 letter code 
corresponding to this language.The languages currently accepted are: <b>deu</b> (German), <b>eng</b> (English), <b>esp</b> (Spanish), <b>fra</b> (French), <b>hun</b> (Hungarian), <b>ita</b> (Italian), <b>jpn</b> (Japanese), <b>lao</b> (Lao), 
<b>msa</b> (Malay), <b>tha</b> (Thai), <b>vie</b> (Vietnamese), etc.<br>
No other file than info_doc.xml and no other folder should be on the archive root, otherwise the document will be treated as a monolingual one.</p>
<h4>1 Multilingual HTML archives</h4>
<p>Each folder bearing a language name must at least contain a file named index.htm(l) or default.htm(l) that will be the entry point for this language. If there's no info_doc.xml file, you can fill in the <b>Author</b> field of the form; the document's titles for each language will be retrieved from the &lt;title&gt; tag of the index files.<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
<IMG SRC="media/html_archive.jpg" ALT="Multilingual HTML archive" BORDER=1></p>
<h4>2 Multilingual non-HTML archives</h4>
<p>Each folder bearing a language name must contain exactly one file, wich is the version of the document in this language. The information file info_doc.xml is required.<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
<IMG SRC="media/media_archive.jpg" ALT="Multilingual non-HTML archive" BORDER=1></p>
<h4>3 Monolingual archives</h4>
<p>If it consists of a set of HTML page, a file named index.htm(l) or default.htm(l) is required on the archive root.
If there is no info_doc.xml, you must fill in the <b>Title</b> field of the form and indicate the language of the document.<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
<IMG SRC="media/mono_archive.jpg" ALT="Monolingual archive" BORDER=1></p><br>
<h2>2. Addition of simple files</h2>
<p>You have to type a title and select the language of the document.</p>
