Modifications since Papillon5.0 :
  - Adapted Papillon source to compile with enhydra 5.1
  - All entries are now stored as contributions, even original ones.
  - Interface is now generated and should be modified by hand...
  - Metadata now make use of XPath to indicate elements that should be indexed.
  - Reverse lookup may be authorized for a dictionary by way of the d:reverse attribute.
  - upload de dictionnaire/volume/etc. in a transaction + rollback if a pb occurs.
  - The Layout is now configurable in the conf file.
  - Volume whose source language is "axi" is now considered as the pivot volume in a pivot dictionary.

  - MM: Added the possibility to export in PDF format. The conversion into PDF is done via the fop package that has to be installed (see ToolsForPapillon)
  - MM: Corrected an important bug in the editor that forbidded to change a boolean value from true to false.
Beware, you have to edit the existing interface templates by hands:
 1- duplicate all the input elements with name='boolean' and type='checkbox'.
 - for each input element pair,    
   2- change one input element name into name='booleantrue' 
   3- change the other input element type to type='hidden'
